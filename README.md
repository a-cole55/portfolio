Portfolio

Description:
My portfolio is a responsive, static site which shows a few of my recent coding projects. This porfolio is the online equivalency of your proud mom hanging your adorable (yet not aesthetically pleasing) paintings on the fridge as a kid. This project uses HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript (none at the time of creating this file). You can access this project live at https://www.acolee.netlify.app. I hope you enjoy!
